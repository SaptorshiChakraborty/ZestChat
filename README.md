ZestChat: Zero-knowledge Encrypted Serverless Transferrable Chat

Abstract

ZestChat is a pseudonymous, browser-native, peer-to-peer chat messenger and file transfer protocol, offering unlimited data transfer without the need for centralized servers. Unlike mainstream messaging platforms, ZestChat prioritizes privacy, security, and freedom by running directly in the browser—installation-free, censorship-resistant, and accessible to everyone.

About the Project

Browser-native experience: Runs directly in browsers, eliminating downloads or logins.

Unlimited communication: Encrypted text, file transfer with no data caps.

Unlimited File Transfer: *Single file transfer size limit of 200 KB applies for each transfer due to minimal infrastructure running the browser-native web application although number of file transfers is unlimited and completely depends on the user’s hardware capabilities.*

Privacy-first: AES-GCM-grade encryption ensures secure, pseudonymous communication.

Serverless architecture: Free from centralized control, surveillance, or censorship.

This project was conceived by Saptorshi Chakraborty, a seventeen-year-old developer from Kolkata, India. 

ZestChat invites developers, cybersecurity experts, and contributors to expand and harden the platform.
